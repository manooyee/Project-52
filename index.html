             <li>
                There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels
            </li>

            <li>
                Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes
            </li>

            <li>
                Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment
            </li>

            <li>
                Their tongues consist of both muscles and bones, and can bend round to grab their pray
            </li>

            <li>
                The majority of chameleons survive by eating insects, and some complement this diet by feeding on foliage and fruits

        <ul>
            <li>
                Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902
            </li>

            <li>
                The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff
            </li>

            <li>
                The world's smallest stitched teddy bear is a mere 0.29 inches tall! It was created by South African artist Cheryl Moss who is known for her minuscule work.

                The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication
            </li>

            <li>
                At 5 months old, giant pandas learn how to climb - sometimes practicing by climbing on their mum
            </li>

            <li>
                They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food

            <li>
                The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus

            <li>
                Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes.
